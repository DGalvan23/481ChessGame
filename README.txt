Because of compability with python-chess, the bulk of the code is in:
    sub-directory /python-chess-0.15.3/python-chess-0.15.3

To run:
       1. Start two terminals (T1 and T2)
       2. T1: navigate to /481ChessGame/python-chess-0.15.3/python-chess-0.15.3
       3. T2: navigate to /481ChessGame/python-chess-0.15.3/python-chess-0.15.3
       4. T1: Run this command to start the game as player X.
           python3 chessmain.py X
       5. T2: Run this command to start the game as player Y.
           python3 chessmain.py Y
       6. Watch either terminal (or both at the same time) to see the game play.
       7. Review the log files log_X.txt and log_Y.txt
